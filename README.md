# Curiosity

   - wordlist.c -> contains the function to generate customized wordlist
   
   - more.c -> contains information about WEP, WPA2, developer and more
   
   - main.c -> the main menu
   
   - "name".h -> is the header file of "name".c; you can write another main.c and #include "name".h
   
   Compile the main.c with gcc (or a compiler uploading both file .c and file .h) and enjoy!
   File .c and .h have to be in the same sub-folder.

# Note

   The differences between Windows and Linux version are just for system call.
